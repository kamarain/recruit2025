    <p>
        We are seeking new PhD students and postdocs to our computer vision and machine learning research teams in Helsinki and
        Tampere in Finland.
    </p>
    <p>
        The positions will offer excellent opportunities to work in a team of professionals responsible for developing
        cutting edge computer vision and machine learning technology, and allows you to learn many aspects from
        fundamental research problems to concrete applications.
    </p>


    <h2>Applicant</h2>

    <p>
        We welcome applications with any research focus related to computer vision and machine learning. In addition, we
        are especially seeking candidates with the following research focus:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Large-scale multi modal learning (e.g. audio, visual, and language)</li>
        <li>Deep learning based 3D scene reconstruction</li>
        <li>Augmented reality for games and mobile applications (Android and/or iOS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Ideal candidate has a strong programming and mathematics background. Experience in (or strong will to learn)
        programming with Python or C++/Java are considered as advantages.
    </p>


    <h2>Team and research</h2>

    <p>
        The doctoral candidates will be supervised by <a href="http://esa.rahtu.fi" rel="some text">Professor Esa
            Rahtu</a> (Tampere University) and <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~kannalj1/" rel="some text">Associate
            Professor Juho Kannala</a> (Aalto University). We work broadly in the fields of computer vision and machine
        learning. We are pursuing research problems in geometric computer vision (including topics such as visual SLAM,
        visual-inertial odometry, and 3D scene reconstruction), in semantic computer vision (including topics such as
        image-based localization, object detection and recognition, and deep learning), and large-scale multi modal
        learning (including audio-visual sound source separation, visually guided sound generation, and audio-visual
        synchronization). More information of our research is available on our web pages linked below. (You can follow
        the links by clicking the images.)

    <h3>Visual-inertial odometry</h3>

    <p>
        We have developed a visual-inertial odometry method based on an information fusion framework employing low-cost
        IMU sensors and monocular or stereo camera. Our approach utilizes strong coupling between inertial and visual
        data sources which leads to robustness against occlusion and feature-poor environments. The video explains our
        method presented in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11857">paper</a>.

    </div>

    <h3>Image based localisation and SLAM</h3>

    <p>
        We have investigated machine learning based approaches for visual localization and SLAM systems. For instance,
        we have developed a CNN-based <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04999">scene coordinate regression
            method</a> for image-based localization. The new model can be trained without careful initialization, and
        the system achieves accurate results. Another example is a method for scalable and fully 3D magnetic field SLAM
        using local anomalies in the magnetic field as a source of position information.
    </p>

    <h3>Visually guided audio generation</h3>
    <p>
        The generation of visually relevant, high-quality sounds is a longstanding challenge of deep learning. Solving
        this challenge would allow sound designers to spend less time searching large foley databases for the sound that
        is relevant to a specific video scene. We approach the visually guided sound generation by shrinking a training
        dataset of audio spectrograms to a set of representative vectors aka. a codebook. Similar to word tokens in
        language modeling, these codebook vectors can be used by a transformer to sample a representation that can be
        easily decoded into a spectrogram and subsequently to audio stream. The video explains our
        approach presented in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08791">paper</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Audio-visual synchronisation</h3>

    <p>
        Audio-visual synchronisation is the task of determining the temporal offset between the audio (sound) and visual
        (image) streams in a video. In recent literature, this task has been explored by exploiting strong correlations
        between the audio and visual streams, e.g. in human speech and playing instruments, to provide a training signal
        for deep neural networks. Rather than focusing on a specialised domain, such as human speech, we explore AV
        synchronisation for videos of general thematic content, e.g. daily videos and live sports. For more information,
        take a look at our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07055">paper</a>

            synchronisation requires a model to relate changes in the visual and audio streams. Prior work focused
            primarily on the synchronisation of talking head videos (left). In contrast, open-domain videos often have a
            small visual indication, i.e. sparse in space (right). Moreover, cues may be intermittent and scattered,
            i.e. sparse across time, e.g. a lion only roars once during a video clip.</figcaption>
